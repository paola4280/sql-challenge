# sql-challenge

This activity contains two folders, one with the data and one with all the results. The one called Employees has all the solutions to the challenge questions. There are two SQL files, one with the table creation and one with the queries. There is also a folder with screenshots of each query with the corresponding table. Additionally, there is an ERD screenshot and an ERD document summarizing the visual. 

This challenge aims to practice creating tables, importing, and doing queries using SQL. Some of the topics we cover were creating a table, creating an ERD, importing data from a csv file, querying data from a table or multiple tables at the same time, placing conditions while doing a query, etc.

I had some issues importing the csv files and I needed lots of help from my instructors and AskBCSLearning. They were my main source of knowledge during this assignment. I also used my class notes and chatGPT for debugging.
